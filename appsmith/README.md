# Appsmith

Appsmith is a low code, open-source framework to build internal applications.
With our JavaScript-based visual development platform, build CRUD apps, Dashboards, Admin Panels, and many more 10x faster.
You can use our pre-built UI widgets, connect them to your APIs and databases to build dynamic apps and complex workflows. And the best part? Deploy these apps on the technology you prefer! (self-host for free!).
